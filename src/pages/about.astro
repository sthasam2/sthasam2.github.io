  <h2>Just a curious mind building cool stuff on the web.</h2>

  <p>
    Hey there! I'm someone who loves exploring ideas and creating things — especially on the web.
    This site is my digital playground where I try new things, break stuff (on purpose sometimes),
    and keep learning as I go.
  </p>

  <p>
    Right now, this is just the beginning — but stick around. There's a lot more coming, and you
    might just catch a glimpse of something awesome in the making.
  </p>

  <p>My skills are:</p>
  <ul>
    {skills.map((skill) => <li class="skill">{skill}</li>)}
  </ul>
</BaseLayout>
