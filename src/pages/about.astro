    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <h2>Just a curious mind building cool stuff on the web.</h2>

    <p>
      Hey there! I'm someone who loves exploring ideas and creating things — especially on the web.
      This site is my digital playground where I try new things, break stuff (on purpose sometimes),
      and keep learning as I go.
    </p>

    <p>
      Right now, this is just the beginning — but stick around. There's a lot more coming, and you
      might just catch a glimpse of something awesome in the making.
