# My First Blog Post 🚀

**Published on:** July 1, 2022

Welcome to my little corner of the web — and my very first blog post! I'm starting this blog to document my journey into web development, and this post marks the beginning of something exciting.

## What I've Built So Far

Here’s what I’ve managed to pull off so far:

1. ✅ **Set up my project** – Got everything installed and running smoothly. That “new project” smell is real.
2. ✅ **Created some pages** – Started playing around with `.astro` files and made my first few static pages.
3. ✅ **Launched this blog** – You're reading the first post! Markdown is pretty nice, honestly.

## What's Next?

I’ll be continuing to build, learn, and probably break a few things along the way. More posts, more features, and a better site are all on the roadmap.

If you’re into learning in public, messing with code, or just want to follow along, stick around — it’s only up from here.
